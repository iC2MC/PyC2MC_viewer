# PyC2MC Viewer
This package, called PyC2MC, has been in development since 2020 and is based on the commonly used Python language with the goal of being
improvable even by people outside of the initial project. Indeed, the goal of this work is to provide a robust data visualization tool producing
numerous plots as well as statistical analysis to ease the sample molecular fingerprinting and the inter-sample comparison. With the aim to deliver
an easy-to-use application, we use a PyQT based graphical user interface designed under QtDesigner. Most of the application’s features are based on
the molecular formulae attributed by either constructor or third-party software.

To use this software, there are two options:

=> Download and start the executable version at the following link : https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7602288
 .

=> Run "Main.py" in the Python interpreter of your choice after having installed the required packages found in "Requirements.txt" or importing "environment.yaml" via Anaconda3.
